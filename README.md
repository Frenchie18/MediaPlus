# MediaPlus
## Summary
Media+ is a media organizer intended to facilitate easy collection, searching, and organization of local media files (mainly images and videos). It is built using C++, Qt, and SQLite.

## Usage Notes
At the moment,  while Media+ does some rudimentary tests for missing directories and files, it does not include automatic creation of missing directories. This means that, when the program is compiled, the subdirectories "Data" and "Media" will need to be placed in the same directory. Additionally, the "Media" subdirectory will need to contain a directory titled, "Images".

More information will be added to the README as this project is developed further.
